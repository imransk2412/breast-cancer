# Breast Cancer Classification

This project uses the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn to build a classification model that predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features like mean radius, smoothness, etc.

## Model:
- *Logistic Regression* was used for the classification task.

## Results:
- Accuracy: 98.68%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: (Provide these metrics from your classification report)

## Conclusion:
The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the breast cancer tumors. Further improvements can be made using other classification algorithms.
